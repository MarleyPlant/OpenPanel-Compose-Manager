# Features
The idea is that a user is able to have a compose stack which can be managed via the web ui
- Execute Commands in your docker containers with custom commands
	- For example resetting passwords, changing configs, etc. instead of doing it in the CLI you have a nice interface standardised accross all your different application stacks
- Volume management
    - Look at using an existing framework for service config files eg casaos where there is a config file in every template that defines the parameters and template variables to structure your project to spec
- Reverse Proxy and Port Mappings
- Template Apps
