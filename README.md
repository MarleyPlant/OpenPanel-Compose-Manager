# Docker Composer Manager
The idea is that a user is able to have a compose stack which can be managed via the web ui
- Commands With Parameters and which container it will be run on
- Volume management
    - Look at using an existing framework for service config files eg casaos where there is a config file in every template that defines the parameters and template variables to structure your project to spec
